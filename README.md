# Bank OCR Refactoring Kata
This kata currently includes working code and tests.  Your mission is to refactor the code with the Single Responsibility Principle in mind.  While the first thing on your mind should be SRP, don't be afraid to use other design principles to make this happen.

This kata is a python version of a kata done by [DarthStrom](https://github.com/DarthStrom/bank-ocr-refactoring-kata)

## More info on the Single Responsibility Principle:

## Here are some questions to ask as you refactor
- Who are the actors that would want changes to the code?
- Can we isolate the concerns of each actor to separate functions?
- Are there groups of functions that belong in separate modules?
